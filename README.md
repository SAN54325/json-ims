# json-ims
My Name is Santhosh.Iam doing my btech 3rd year at vardhaman college of engineering.
In this repositary i have made a simple inventory mangement system with help of json files
we have record.json file consisting of products
Products has 5 attributes
1.Product Name
2.Cost of Product
3.Expiry Date
4.Type of product(drinks,phones etc..,)
5.quantity

Import json then dump the record values in record.
JSON is converted into dictonary
The custmor can purchase items by entering product id and quantity needed.
After purchasing it is updated to the record.json file

json as per sales we will modify json files then convert into dictonary then custmor can start his shopping then he enters product id and quantity after his shopping then changes will occur in record.json and sales.json files There is a records.json file of available products convert json into dictonary in python

Then we are supposed to store the data into a json file with .json extension. The logic of the code is to get sales that occured in a day.

Store the sales data into another sales.json
 this is about my project.
